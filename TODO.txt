- Create an MMDBManager DONE
- Read a file DONE
- Wrap fftw DONE
- Wrap clipper DONE
- Read an MTZ DONE
- Do a SF calculation DONE
- Put all the above in a browser DONE
- Wrap ssm DONE
- Use optimization (-O2) DONE
- Log to HTML element rather than/as well as console.log DONE
- Use embind to expose methods/objects better DONE
- Make calls asynchronous. Web workers DONE
- Make web superpose example DONE
- Wrap gsl, I think this more or less works out of the box with:
    autoreconf -i
    emconfigure ./configure --prefix=<somewhere>
    emmake make LDFLAGS=-all-static
    emmake make install

  After that we can use <somewhere>/lib/libgsl.a DONE

- Wrap a class, e.g. clipper:XMap<float>.
  - Wrap Cell DONE
  - Wrap Cell_descr DONE
  - Wrap Xmap<float> DONE

  Only issue unresolved is passing this from Web Worker to main thread
  (or other worker), the returned xmap is cast to Object in postMessage.
  This implies: all uses of custom objects is done in same thread; or
  objects are communicated between threads by serializing/deserializing
  if necessary.

- Test RDKit: https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/tree/master/Code/MinimalLib
  Works as expected. No idea if functionality is sufficient for Coot's needs. DONE

- Display an svg/canvas ligand representation
  - Get ligand ids from coord file. DONE
  - Get cif dictionary from server (simple monomer library server) DONE
  - Construct mol block from dictionary DONE
  - Render mol as svg in div DONE

- Incorporate into react app (with servername tweak). DONE

o Make a repository (This is a git repo, but has no remote server, and is mirrored in MG jsmodules branch.)

- Build libpng emscripten port DONE, but probably uneccessary as emscripten ports seems ot do the trick
  - git clone https://github.com/emscripten-ports/zlib.git
    cd zlib
    emcmake cmake .
    emmake make
  - git clone https://github.com/emscripten-ports/libpng.git
    cd libpng
    emcmake cmake  -DZLIB_LIBRARY=$PWD/../zlib/libz.a -DZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR=$PWD/../zlib -DM_LIBRARY="" .
    emmake make

* Wrap Coot
  - Download coot-0.9.6
    emcmake cmake .
    emmake make

  * ligand/res-tracer.cc depends on  scored-node.hh which seems not to exist.
