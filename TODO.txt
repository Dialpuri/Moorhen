o Wrap gsl, I think this more or less works out of the box with:
    autoreconf -i
    emconfigure ./configure
    emmake make LDFLAGS=-all-static

  After that we can use gsl-2.7/.libs/libgsl.a DONE

  Need to test this.

* Wrap a class, e.g. clipper:XMap<float>.
  - Wrap Cell DONE
  - Wrap Cell_descr DONE
  - Wrap Xmap<float> DONE

  Only issue unresolved is passing this from Web Worker to main thread
  (or other worker), the returned xmpa is cast to Object in postMessage.

o Make a repository (This is a git repo, but has no remote server).
* Test RDKit: https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/tree/master/Code/MinimalLib
* Wrap Coot
