* Update README with all changes in README.md.

* Split coot into library and executables. An almost accurate list can be got from:

  find checkout/coot-0.9.6/ -name \*.cpp -o -name \*.cc | xargs grep -w main | grep -w int 

* Make a Coot library example, e.g.:

  * src/fix-nomenclature.cc

* Check problem with one Coot source file ligand/res-tracer.cc depends on scored-node.hh which seems not to exist.
